The series has sound coverage of all the grammar topics, supported by grammar notes, language notes, vocabulary activities, writing composition and reading comprehension techniques for developing the four skills (Listening, Speaking, Reading and Writing) of the English language.\nThe grammatical activities in the series represent a blend of both functional and traditional approaches of teaching English grammar. The activities based on functional grammar are meant to improve communicative competence of students by showing them how texts work in real life situations and how grammar works in the context of different text types. On the other hand, traditional approach to English grammar serves to provide students with the terminology and rules needed to talk about grammar; and help them deal with the terms and typical questions of grammar in various English language tests.\nThe exercises are designed to help students understand grammatical concepts in functional context reinforcing the learning of English in the classroom. Many of the exercises incorporate learner-centered activities that include various learning materials and help students get ample practice in applying grammatical concepts in real-life oral and written English."),Object(i.b)("p",{class:"docsImage"},Object(i.b)("img",{src:"maxim.png",alt:"KINDERFUN-Series-for-Pre-primers"})),Object(i.b)("p",null,"We are really grateful to all the teachers and students of government and private schools who helped us in piloting the series.
